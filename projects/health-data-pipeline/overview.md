# Metadata-Driven Health Data Pipeline

## Context
The Ministry of Health (BC) required a robust data solution to support multiple health-related research projects. Data flows lacked consistency and metadata traceability, affecting quality and access.

## Objective
Build metadata-rich ETL pipelines that improve data availability, quality, and research readiness, while ensuring compliance with governance standards.

## Tech Stack
- Python, SQL, Azure
- Metadata schema design
- GitLab, Jira
- ER modeling, process decomposition

## Architecture
Raw Systems → Ingestion (Python/SQL) → Staging → Metadata Engine → Provisioning → Secure Access

## Key Contributions
- Built scalable ETL pipelines
- Developed metadata engine for lineage
- Improved data quality through anomaly detection
- Integrated pipelines with GitLab and Jira

## Impact
- Reduced provisioning time by 40%
- Increased metadata capture compliance to 85%
- Accelerated research feasibility studies

## Future Plans
- API Gateway for secure dynamic dataset provisioning
